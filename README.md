# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

A Java-based academic management system designed for managing student records, course enrollments, and academic performance tracking.

## Java Evolution & Environment

### Evolution of Java
- Java 1.0 (1996): First release
- Java 1.2-1.4: Collections framework, Assert keyword, Regular expressions
- Java 5: Generics, Enhanced for-loop, Autoboxing
- Java 6-7: JDBC 4.0, Try-with-resources, Diamond operator
- Java 8: Lambda expressions, Stream API, Optional, New Date/Time API
- Current features used: Streams, NIO.2, Lambda expressions, Date/Time API

### Java Editions Comparison

| Feature | Java ME | Java SE | Java EE |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Target | Mobile/Embedded | Desktop/Core | Enterprise |
| Memory | Minimal | Standard | Large |
| Features | Basic subset | Complete core | Enterprise extensions |
| Use Case | IoT devices | Standalone apps | Web/Server apps |

## Syllabus Topic Mapping

| Topic | Implementation Location | Description |
|-------|------------------------|-------------|
| Classes & Objects | `domain/*.java` | Domain models using OOP |
| Inheritance | `Person.java`, `Student.java` | Student inherits from Person |
| Interfaces | `service/Searchable.java` | Service interfaces |
| Exception Handling | `exception/*.java` | Custom exceptions |
| Collections | `StudentService.java` | HashMap for student storage |
| Generics | `service/Searchable.java` | Generic type parameters |
| Stream API | `StudentService.java` | Student filtering and search |
| File I/O | `io/ImportExportService.java` | CSV import/export |
| Date & Time API | `domain/Student.java` | Timestamp handling |
| Assertions | Throughout codebase | Precondition checking |

## Assertions

To enable assertions when running the program:
```bash
java -ea edu.ccrm.Main
```

Assertions are used for:
- Input validation
- State invariants
- Precondition checking
- Internal logic verification
